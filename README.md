#Reactjs
This repository is created for the purpose learning ReactJS for beginners.

This project was bootstrapped with <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">Create React App.</a>

Creating an App
You’ll need to have Node 8.16.0 or Node 10.16.0 or later version on your local development machine (but it’s not required on the server). You can use nvm (macOS/Linux) or nvm-windows to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

To create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:

<b>npx</b>

npx create-react-app my-app
(npx comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see instructions for older npm versions)
